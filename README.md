# ðŸ“± Memory game

This project is a memory game created . It is a web-based game where the player's objective is to match pairs of cards with the same image. The game starts with a grid of facedown cards, and the player must flip two cards at a time to reveal their images. If the images match, the cards remain face up; otherwise, they are flipped back face down. The player's goal is to match all the pairs of cards within a certain number of moves or within a set time limit.

The game includes various levels of difficulty, allowing players to choose the number of cards on the grid and adjust the level of challenge. It also features a scoring system that tracks the number of moves made and the time taken to complete the game, encouraging players to improve their performance with each playthrough.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing memory game. It showcases the developer's skills in front-end web development, including implementing game logic, handling user interactions, and designing an intuitive user interface.

Overall, this memory game project offers an enjoyable and challenging experience for players of all ages, testing their memory skills and providing entertainment through a simple yet engaging gameplay mechanic.
